## What is NorthStar Aurora?

NorthStar Aurora replaces the complexity of juggling multiple tools for pixel light shows. One platform to **design layouts**, **sequence shows with AI**, and **control playback** — all from a single touch-first interface.

### The Problem
Creating a professional pixel light show means hours of manual effect placement in xLights, separate tools for layout design, and Falcon Player for playback. A single song can take 20-40 hours to sequence manually.

### The Solution
Upload your music. AI analyzes rhythm, energy, tempo, and mood — then automatically generates perfectly synchronized light sequences with professional effects, smooth transitions, and pixel-level rendering. In minutes, not days.
